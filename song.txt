I woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot about yesterday, remembering
I'm pretendin' to be who I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistakes, slow to react
And even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories, even if you're not with me

I'm with you (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
With you (You, now I see, even when I close my eyes)
